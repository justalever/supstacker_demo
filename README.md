# Let's Build: A Supplement Stack Sharing App with Ruby on Rails

Welcome to my latest Letâ€™s build series.

Over the course of time Iâ€™ve added a number of these builds which have seemed to resonate with a lot of my audience.

I find these both useful from first principles product ideas but also nice way to practice for myself to see how quickly I can build an MVP of product ideas I have. Luckily with Rails, this can be done in little time

## Supstacker data modeling

- `User` - The model responsible for a given entity who might add and share supplment stacks.
- `Stack` - A collection of products a user can share.
- `Product` - Get's shared inside a Stack. Has richer data like price, description, title, etc.
- `Brand` - The brand of the supplement. One brand per supplement.
